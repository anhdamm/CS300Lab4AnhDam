- 4 rows and 4 columns, each row specifies a lighting model
  - 1st row: Emissive lighting
  - 2nd row: Ambient lighting
  - 3rd row: Ambient + diffuse lightings
  - 4th row: Ambient + diffuse + specular lightings
- Color of each row (from left to right): 
  - 1st row: jade, pearl, ruby, turquoise
  - 2nd row: emerald, bronze, gold, brass
  - 3rd row: cyan, red, white, yellow with plastic material
  - 4th row: cyan, red, white, yellow with rubber material
- Move object with mouse and light changes as mouse changes
